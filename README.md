## Iris Flower Classification
Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project repository! In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica based on their measurements.

## Introduction
Iris flowers are known for their distinct speciesâ€”setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species differ in their sepal and petal measurements. Our goal is to leverage machine learning to develop a model that can accurately classify iris flowers based on these measurements.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:

Id: Unique identifier for each data entry
SepalLengthCm: Length of the sepal in centimeters
SepalWidthCm: Width of the sepal in centimeters
PetalLengthCm: Length of the petal in centimeters
PetalWidthCm: Width of the petal in centimeters
Species: The target variable indicating the species of the iris flower

## Getting Started
To replicate and explore this project, you can follow these steps:

## Clone the Repository:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-flower-classification.git
Explore the Code:

Open the iris_classification.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to see the Python code for training the machine learning model.
Run the Code:

Execute the code cells in the notebook to train the model and make predictions.
Evaluate the Model:

Review the accuracy, confusion matrix, and other evaluation metrics to understand the performance of the model.

## Dataset Source
While the Scikit-learn library provides a standard dataset for iris flower classification, you can find the dataset used in this project in the iris.csv file in the repository.

Feel free to use this dataset for your own experiments and analyses.

## Acknowledgments
The iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for educational purposes.
